Use Python to calculate how many different passwords can be formed with 6 lower case English letters.  For a 1 letter password, there would be 26 possibilities.  For a 2 letter password, each letter is independent of the other, so there would be 26 times 26 possibilities.  Using this information, print the amount of possible passwords that can be formed with 6 letters.

a=26**6;
print(a);
